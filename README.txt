In Lieu of a presentation, I and my teammates would like to take the opportunity to welcome you to our small contribution
to carleton's wonderful engineering and computer culture.  Our app, Thats_So_Ravens features a character, Rodney the raven
as a first year student who has been accepted into Carleton's SCE department as a Systems/Software Engineer to be.
Rodney, as all first years seem to faces a number of challenges along the way.

He must as all young Softies have to, brave the tunnels and the labyrinth that is ARCH building to find his first lab
simulated by a labyrinth/"don't touch the walls" game which is relatively challenging when played using the kinect
interface.

Rodney must also take on what could be considered one of the greatest challenges of all time for any engineering
student: Passing the ECOR 1010 Intro to Engineering Midterm. This is simulated by way of an interactive and informative
quiz about the department of SCE showcasing the many achievements of its faculty, the history of the department, along
with a few little engineering memories that just about everyone to ever step foot into Minto should be forcibly made
aware of, like how a giant muffin and coffee only costs $1.75 at The engineering caffe.

Possibly rodney's greatest challenge is to decipher and somehow pass the feared PHYS 1004 Class, with a 60% DFW rate, the
course lives up to its reputation as one of the hardest courses in first year that engineering students are faced with.
The simulation is called "Pure Magic" and is a fairly accurate representation of what it may feel like to some students
going through this class. Frequently felling like you're just shooting electricity at a wall with your pencil. In this
simulation you are doing just that. Rodney enters the Class Room (roughly designed to look like bell theater) to find
his professors ready and waiting for him with a surprise test. Rodney must defend himself with the textbook while
striking back with a charged capacitor in order to claim victory and the A+ he deserves.

*Note, It is advised that while playing the game until the next delivery (only a few days away) that this final
mini-game be played last as losing it will result in ejection from the school AKA cause the program to crash*

Also upcoming in the following days of development before the project can be considered complete is some more
positioning work of the characters as well as an update to the models and textures used for rodney and his arms in the
pure magic game.
 - Info Boxes will be implemented in advance of each game, hopefully((granted we receive permission) taking on the
    voice and likeness of well liked and recognized professors in SCE.
 - Update to maze textures which will allow for a more varied and random appearance of the tunnels and buildings.


 I hope you enjoy our Game.
